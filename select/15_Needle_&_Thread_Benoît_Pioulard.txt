Tie your tether on (the knot keeps slipping out)
Eyes wide, breathe deep, blood flow, push through
Expand to keep, contract & rue
Pools round your feet, eyes with circles

You were a sweet pursuit held fast with city roots
Neglected by the chute, our gaze is rendered mute

Feel a tender warmth & numbness
Blissfully detached from all this
Noise & dust from absent makers
Made beds to sleep with forsakers

These words are not mine, I just put them in a line
& Hang them down like vines, all letters dry with time
Use them for little white lies, clearer in sheltered sighs
With clumsy hopeful tries, they help make you your size
