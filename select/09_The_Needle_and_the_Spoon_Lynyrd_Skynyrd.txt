Thirty day's, lord and thirty night's
I'm comin' home on an airplane flight
Mama waitin' at the ticket line
"Tell me son why do you stand there cryin'"

It was the needle and the spoon
And a trip to the moon
Took me away, took me away

I've been feelin' so sick inside
"Got to get better, lord before I die"
Seven doctors couldn't help my head, they said
"You better quit, son before your dead"

Quit the needle, quit the spoon
Quit the trip to the moon
We gonna take you away
Lord, we gonna take you away

It was the needle and the spoon
Shit!

I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool
But then again, lord I've seen a lot of fool's
Well, I hope you people, lord can hear what I say
You'll have your chance to hit it some day

Don't mess with the needle or a spoon
Or any trip to the moon
It'll take you away

"Lord, they're gonna bury you boy"
"Don't mess with the needle"
Now I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
